### Thread 1: The Problem/Solution

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
I just spent 3 days after a conference sorting through business cards and scattered notes.

Never again.

Introducing ActionNotes.ai — your AI-powered conference command center 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
Here's what happens at most conferences:
• Collect 50+ business cards
• Take notes in 3 different apps
• Forget 80% of conversations by day 2
• Follow up on maybe 5 contacts

Sound familiar?

**Tweet 3:**
ActionNotes.ai fixes this with AI:

✅ Text, voice, or photo notes — AI processes everything  
✅ Scan business cards → instant contact creation  
✅ GPT-4 extracts action items & topics automatically  
✅ Auto-drafts follow-up emails with conversation context  

**Tweet 4:**
The business card scanner is *chef's kiss*

Point camera → AI extracts name, email, company, LinkedIn → Creates rich contact with meeting context

Takes 2 seconds. Zero manual entry.

**Tweet 5:**
End of conference? One click generates:
• Executive summary
• Prioritized action items  
• All contacts with context
• Draft follow-up emails

Ready to send before you leave the venue.

**Tweet 6:**
We're launching today with early bird pricing:

**$19 for lifetime access** (no subscription)

All future updates included.

### Post 1: Founder Story

I spent 10 years attending conferences.

Every single time, I'd come home with:
→ A pocket full of business cards
→ Notes scattered across 5 apps
→ Great conversations I couldn't remember
→ Promised follow-ups that never happened

Sound familiar?

Today, I'm launching the solution.

ActionNotes.ai is your AI-powered conference command center:

✨ Multi-format capture: Text, voice, photos, business cards
✨ AI processing: GPT-4 extracts insights, action items, topics
✨ Smart contacts: Auto-created with LinkedIn & context
✨ One-click reports: End-of-day summaries with next steps
✨ AI follow-ups: Drafted emails referencing your actual conversations

The business card scanner alone is worth it. Point your camera, AI extracts everything instantly.

We're offering lifetime access for $19 to celebrate the launch.

If you network for business, this pays for itself after one event.

### Post 2: Feature Highlight

The problem with most "networking apps":

They do ONE thing well.

Scan cards OR take notes OR manage contacts.

Never the whole workflow.

ActionNotes.ai does it ALL:

1️⃣ CAPTURE: Text, voice, photos, business cards
2️⃣ PROCESS: AI extracts meaning, entities, action items
3️⃣ ANALYZE: Relationship scores, topic clustering, sentiment
4️⃣ FOLLOW UP: AI-drafted emails with conversation context

One platform. Complete workflow. Zero friction.

Just launched with early bird pricing ($19 lifetime):

### Post 3: The ROI Argument

Quick math for conference attendees:

Average conference cost: $1,000-3,000
Travel & hotel: $1,500-5,000
Time invested: 3-4 days

And how many valuable connections do you actually follow up with?

10%? 20%?

ActionNotes.ai helps you capture and act on 100% of meaningful interactions.

For $19. One time. Forever.

The ROI is absurd.
