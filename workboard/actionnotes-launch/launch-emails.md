## Email 2: Feature Deep Dive (Send Day 2)

**Subject:** The business card scanner that actually works

Hi [First Name],

Yesterday we launched ActionNotes.ai and the response has been incredible.

I wanted to share the #1 feature people are raving about:

**The Business Card Scanner**

Point your camera. That's it.

Our AI (powered by Google Vision) instantly extracts:
- Name & title
- Email & phone
- Company & website
- LinkedIn profile (auto-discovered)
- Meeting context & notes

No manual entry. No typos. No lost contacts.

**Real user quote:**
"I scanned 47 business cards at TechCrunch Disrupt. Took maybe 5 minutes total. Every contact is now in my CRM with full context."

## Email 3: Social Proof (Send Day 3)

**Subject:** "This paid for itself after one conference"

Hi [First Name],

72 hours since launch and we're hearing amazing feedback:

💬 *"I used to spend 3 days after every conference sorting through notes. Now I have my follow-up emails drafted before I leave the venue."* — Sarah K., Product Manager

💬 *"The AI extracted action items I completely missed in my own notes. Game changer."* — Marcus T., Founder

💬 *"$19 is ridiculous for what this does. I've paid $50 for apps that just scan business cards."* — Jennifer L., Sales Director

### Why it works:
Most conference apps do ONE thing (scan cards, take notes, etc.).

ActionNotes.ai does the ENTIRE workflow:
Capture → Process → Analyze → Follow Up

**Early bird ends tonight at midnight.**
