## ActionNotes.ai Launches AI-Powered Conference Command Center to Revolutionize Networking

**New app eliminates post-conference chaos with instant note capture, AI-powered insights, and automated follow-ups**

[City, State] — [Date] — ActionNotes.ai today announced the official launch of its AI-powered conference networking platform, designed to transform how professionals capture, process, and act on conference interactions. The platform combines GPT-4 intelligence with multi-format input capabilities to ensure no valuable connection or insight is ever lost.

### The Conference Networking Problem

Every year, professionals attend conferences, collect business cards, take notes, and return home with stacks of paper and scattered digital files. Within days, critical details fade, promised follow-ups are forgotten, and potentially valuable connections go cold. ActionNotes.ai solves this with a unified command center that works from a web app or WhatsApp.

"We built ActionNotes.ai because we were tired of leaving conferences with pockets full of business cards and zero follow-through," said [Founder Name], CEO of ActionNotes.ai. "Our AI doesn't just store notes—it extracts meaning, identifies action items, and even drafts personalized follow-up emails. It's like having an executive assistant dedicated to your conference experience."

### Key Features

**Multi-Format Capture**: Users can capture notes via text, voice, or photos—including business card scanning with Google Vision OCR. The AI processes each input in real-time.

**AI-Powered Insights**: GPT-4 automatically extracts entities, action items, topics, and sentiment from every note, creating a searchable, structured database of conference intelligence.

**Business Card Scanner**: Point a camera at any business card and AI instantly extracts name, email, phone, company, and LinkedIn profile—automatically creating a rich contact record.

**Smart Contact Management**: Auto-created contacts include meeting context, relationship scores, LinkedIn profiles, and follow-up tracking.

**One-Click Reports**: Generate end-of-day executive summaries with prioritized action items and contact highlights.

**AI Follow-Up Emails**: GPT-4 drafts personalized follow-up emails referencing actual conversation topics, ready to send or customize.
